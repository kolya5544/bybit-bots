## Breakdown

There are different categories of bots presented in this repository.

| Directory | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [`simplest_examples`](https://github.com/kolya5544/bybit-bots/tree/master/simplest_examples) | Contains the simplest examples of getting authenticated, make simple requests, request information from the market and so on |

Each category will have examples in some of available languages. You can check out the libraries below.

## Technologies

I don't plan on including any raw REST API bots, so for every language there'll be a specific library used to make things easier for everyone.

| Language | Library | Installation | Environment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| C# | [Bybit.Net by JKorf](https://github.com/JKorf/Bybit.Net) | dotnet add package Bybit.Net | .NET 8 |
| Python | [pybit by Dexter Dickinson](https://github.com/bybit-exchange/pybit) | pip install pybit | Python 3.10 |

Interface used is `Bybit V5 API`. **Unified Trading account is REQUIRED!! Standard Accounts are not supported.**
