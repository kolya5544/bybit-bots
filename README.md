Complexity level refers to the difficulty for beginners to grasp the concepts and understand the code behind each interaction, as well as how complex code is in terms of algorithms used. It's a subjective metric.

## Technologies

I don't plan on including any raw REST API bots, so for every language there'll be a specific library used to make things easier for everyone.

| Language | Library | Installation | Environment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| C# | [Bybit.Net by JKorf](https://github.com/JKorf/Bybit.Net) | dotnet add package Bybit.Net | .NET 8 |
| Python | [pybit by Dexter Dickinson](https://github.com/bybit-exchange/pybit) | pip install pybit | Python 3.10 |

Interface used is `Bybit V5 API`. **Unified Trading account is REQUIRED!! Standard Accounts are not supported.**
